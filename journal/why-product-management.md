# Why Product Management?

I don't think anyone wakes up one day and say YES let's go do product management.

### The year 2000

CS was not that sexy when I was a senior in high school. People who programmed were nerds. I was not a popular girl yet neither was I a jock despite winning the Hall of Fame for being the top athlete of my class.

Biotechnology was the hottest industry in 2005. Tech bubble pretty much just burst not too long ago. You were pretty much crazy if you said you wanted to do CS in college because there was virtually no jobs. School field trips were going to places like Gilead and Genetech to look at some of the works that PhDs were doing in hope of curing someone, someday.

Long story short... burned weekends on extracting biofuel from algae for my independent study. Pipetting until your thumb joint could crack. This was before the invention of the automated pipetting system.

I mess around with some javascript and C++ by completing a Stanford online course (this was before Coursera) but was not terribly inspired. It took forever to load a video and see any output from my code. Hated Matlab in my freshman year of college because I spent more time chasing periods than writing logic.

### The year 2015

After I graduated from med school, I realised that Silicon Valley was making a come-back. Biotech companies deemed high-risk and super long-term investment so the VCs pulled out and put their bets in start-ups. The tech bro culture brew... places got gentrified.

That did not motivate me to go and become a PM. I was perfectly happy building new hospitals in Singapore. Healthcare was crappy in the States and hospitals are a rare commodity. I was happy learning the business side of healthcare.

One fine day after a sync-up with a vendor who is building our internal communication tool, I realised that we could do better. I was not getting what I wanted from the product despite having specific and detailed spec.

There seems to be a lack of understanding of what users wanted. Each project would cost millions of dollar but has terrible usability. By the time we open the hospital, we were in the exact same shape in terms of the technology we use. This is when I started to obsess over principles of building a good product. I read a lot on the weekends.

One of the gaps that I did not really understand data. Sure, I could do statistical analysis for research purpose but I wanted to be able to manipulate data in a way that provide business insights. Big data was the buzzword but I did not really understand how it worked. I started to learn Python on my own time. Every week, I would discover something new. I remember trying out the GBM algorithm using the toy dataset on H2O flow.  I wanted to be _a data scientist_ because data is everywhere in healthcare.

### Becoming the rare pokémon

**2015:** I started out as **a user.** I was a doctor using the tech and EMR on a daily basis.

**2017:** I became **an expert in business process design**. My job was optimising protocols and plan out all the processes in the new hospital. This included tech solutions! Because the product does not live in its own vacuum. It needs users and users need protocols.

**2018**: Then I dabbled in data science because of our business needs. This was the point that I decided to take a deep dive and start my MPH program. Epidemiology uses a lot of the data science technique but in the context of medicine and public health. What I took away from my experience is that I was more of **an analys**t. A statistician is able to tell you which method to use. An analyst looks at the data, do the analysis, and summarise the insights. A data scientist does the analysis but still requires a stakeholder to interpret the insights in a meaningful way.

**2019**: I took courses to learn **front-end web development.**

Ultimately, it is the obsession to build a better tool for doctors, nurses, and patients that led me down the path to becoming a product manager and I ❤️my job despite the many turns that took me here.
